# Tritones-backend

Update as of 9/12:  

Added data model and populated the database for members and board members

Created serializer file to serialize that data into json responses in views.py

Created model and form for "contact us" page and sent the data through a json response so that Angular can communicate with it through HTTPClient

Created Url Paths for the data so that they can be displayed when app is running
